# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libwebp: WebP is a method of lossy compression that can be used on
libwebp: photographic images. The degree of compression is adjustable so a

libwebp: JPEG and JPEG 2000, without loss of image quality.
