# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

opencl-clhpp: For many large applications C++ is the language of choice and so it
opencl-clhpp: seems reasonable to define C++ bindings for OpenCL.
opencl-clhpp: The interface is contained with a single C++ header file cl2.hpp and
opencl-clhpp: all definitions are contained within the namespace cl. There is no
opencl-clhpp: additional requirement to include cl.h and to use either the C++ or
opencl-clhpp: original C bindings; it is enough to simply include cl2.hpp.
opencl-clhpp:
opencl-clhpp: The bindings themselves are lightweight and correspond closely to the
opencl-clhpp: underlying C API. Using the C++ bindings introduces no additional
opencl-clhpp: execution overhead.
