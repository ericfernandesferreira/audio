# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libcamera: **A complex camera support library for Linux, Android, and ChromeOS**
libcamera: Cameras are complex devices that need heavy hardware image processing
libcamera: operations. Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms
libcamera: that must run on a programmable processor. This has traditionally been
libcamera: implemented in a dedicated MCU in the camera, but in embedded devices
libcamera: algorithms have been moved to the main CPU to save cost. Blurring the
libcamera: boundary between camera devices and Linux often left the user with no
libcamera: other option than a vendor-specific closed-source solution.
