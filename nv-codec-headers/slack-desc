# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

nv-codec-headers: External headers are no longer welcome in the ffmpeg codebase because
nv-codec-headers: they increase the maintenance burden. However, in the NVidia case the
nv-codec-headers: vanilla headers need some modifications to be usable in ffmpeg
nv-codec-headers: therefore we still provide them, but in a separate repository.
